# gltriangles
This is a somewhat "modularized" version of one of the basic GLUT example
program "triangles" (from `GLUT/examples/RedBook8/Chapter01`) for
programmable graphics pipelines, i.e. the modern OpenGL specification.

It is just a simple hack to separate the code of `Triangles.hs` into several
modules for better convenience in exploration of basic OpenGL features.

Such a program layout could be used as a Haskell project **skeleton** of a simple
GLUT application.
